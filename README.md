# Ethereum-Standardized-Random-Beacon-Project

I will be implementing a series of commonly used pseudorandom number generators in Solidity and Vyper.
This is to give smart contract developers an easy way to generate numbers for their decentralized applications on Ethereum.

The generators that I anticipated implementing are:
* Mersenne Twister (32-bit variant)
* KISS 
* Linear congruential generators
* Linear-feedback shift registers
* Various WELL generators
* Xorshift
* Xorooshiro128+
